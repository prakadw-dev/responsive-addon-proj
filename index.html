              Troye Sivan Mellet; born 5 June 1995 is an Australian
              singer-songwriter and actor. After gaining popularity as a singer
              on YouTube and in Australian talent competitions, Sivan signed
              with EMI Australia in 2013 and released his third EP, TRXYE
              (2014), which peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200. Its
              lead single, "Happy Little Pill", reached the top 10 on Australian
              music charts. In 2015, he released his fourth extended play, Wild,
              followed by his debut studio album, Blue Neighbourhood. The
              album's lead single, "Youth", became Sivan's first single to enter
              the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 23.
